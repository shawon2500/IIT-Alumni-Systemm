# IIT-Alumni-System
The main motivation of the project is to build a alumni system for IIT-JU and connect the former graduate students and teacher.
Communication is important part of life and sometimes being connected to everyone is hard because every time the details of person we are looking for is not found.
So, we have realized this importance and build this project to make the communication and details finding between the former students and teachers much easier.
Another important motivation of this project building was to implement what we have learnt in our semester and use it in a way that everyone will enjoy the benefit.
